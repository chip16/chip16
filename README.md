Chip16 Project (version 1.3)
============================

The Chip16 emulation project home, with documentation, examples, and help.

## What is Chip16?
An emulation project helping programmers write their first emulator, using a well-defined, relatively simple VM specification.

It also doubles as a cool toy platform to write little games and demos for.

## Where to go - [Wiki](https://github.com/tykel/chip16/wiki)

Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/tykel/chip16/wiki): you will find exchaustive information about the system, and a full list of opcodes to implement.

You will also find rationale for Chip16's development, as well as guides, soon.

## What to get
My work, excluding ROMs:
* [mash16](http://code.google.com/p/mash16) - my own emulator; best choice for Linux 
* [Js16](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~tk2010/chip16) - my alt. emulator, in-browser
* [tchip16](http://code.google.com/p/tchip16) - assembler
* [img16](http://code.google.com/p/img16) - image to sprite converter (also available in the [src](https://github.com/tykel/chip16/tree/master/src) directory)

Others' work (cherry picked):
* [RefChip16](http://code.google.com/p/refchip16) - [Refraction](http://code.google.com/u/refraction) (PCSX2 dev)'s emulator; best choice for Windows
* [hchip](http://github.com/vahokif/hchip) - emulator written in Haskell, for cool people

ROMs:
* browse the [src](https://github.com/tykel/chip16/tree/master/src) directory for documented examples
* a [showcase of my work](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~tk2010/chip16/games), with a ROM pack

## What else?
Other ROMs, emulators, tools and ideas are buried in:
